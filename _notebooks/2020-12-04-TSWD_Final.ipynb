    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "Here, we will take a look at how different competancy areas relate to each other, and appear together in a person. \n",
    "\n",
    "These competancy areas are based on [CASEL 5](https://casel.org/what-is-sel/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CASEL?\n",
    "The [**Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL)**](https://casel.org/about-2/) is a trusted source for knowledge about high-quality, evidence-based social and emotional learning (SEL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SEL?\n",
    "[**Social and emotional learning (SEL)**](https://casel.org/what-is-sel/) is an integral part of education and human development. **SEL** is the _process_ through which all young people and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of SEL\n",
    "Learning about this is importance because according to CASEL \"Research confirms and teachers, parents, and principals agree: **_Social and emotional competencies can be taught, modeled, and practiced and lead to positive student outcomes that are important for success in school and in life_**.\""
