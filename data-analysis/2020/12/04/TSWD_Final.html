<p>Here, we will take a look at how different competancy areas relate to each other, and appear together in a person.</p>
<p>These competancy areas are based on <a href="https://casel.org/what-is-sel/">CASEL 5</a>.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-CASEL?">
<a class="anchor" href="#What-is-CASEL?" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is CASEL?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-CASEL?"> </a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://casel.org/about-2/"><strong>Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL)</strong></a> is a trusted source for knowledge about high-quality, evidence-based social and emotional learning (SEL).</p>
<h3 id="What-is-SEL?">
<a class="anchor" href="#What-is-SEL?" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is SEL?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-SEL?"> </a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://casel.org/what-is-sel/"><strong>Social and emotional learning (SEL)</strong></a> is an integral part of education and human development. <strong>SEL</strong> is the <em>process</em> through which all young people and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions.</p>
<h3 id="Benefits-of-SEL">
<a class="anchor" href="#Benefits-of-SEL" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Benefits of SEL<a class="anchor-link" href="#Benefits-of-SEL"> </a>
</h3>
<p>Learning about this is importance because according to CASEL "Research confirms and teachers, parents, and principals agree: <strong><em>Social and emotional competencies can be taught, modeled, and practiced and lead to positive student outcomes that are important for success in school and in life</em></strong>."</p>

<p>The following plot has been created by using a method called <strong>hierarchial clustering</strong> on the data. It shows how the answers to the survey questions are related to each other.</p>
<p>The diagram also has an attribute on the left side above each line, which refers to what the question signified. From this, it is possible to see which qualities are related to each other, and appeared together in this data.</p>

<p>To read this, we need to see which lines are joined to each other. The closer they are joined on the right, the more related they are.</p>
<p>As we can see, the 3rd and 4th line representing "Self Image" and "Intellectual Curiosity" are joined close to each other which means that they are appeared a lot together.</p>
<p>Another insight is that in the middle section with pink colour, we can see that "Anxiety" and "Inner peace" are related to each other, as one would expect.</p>

<p>The following plot has been created by using a method called k-means clustering on the data after aggregating the data under different categories like "Anxiety", "Empathy", "Humour", etc. (These categories are mentioned on the right legend).</p>

<p>We can see in the above plot, people in Cluster 1 had low empathy and compassion, were mostly male (encoded 1 in data), extroverted, and nature lovers amongst other things.</p>
